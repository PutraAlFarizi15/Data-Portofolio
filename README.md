---|---|---|---|---
[Face Recognition Attendance System Using Facenet](https://github.com/PutraAlFarizi15/Face-Recognition-Attendance-System-Using-Facenet) | Independent | Face Recognition | Pillow, NumPy, Matplotlib, Keras-Facenet, OpenCV-Python, SciPy, TensorFlow, Pandas, Flask, Streamlit, Streamlit-WebRTC, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn | This project aims to build a face recognition-based attendance system that uses FaceNet technology. The system is designed to replace manual attendance methods in a faster, more accurate, and secure way. FaceNet technology allows the system to recognize and verify an individual's identity through analysis of their face, which is then used to record attendance.
[Carrot Freshness Classification Using InceptionV3](https://github.com/PutraAlFarizi15/Carrot-Freshness-Classification-Using-InceptionV3) | Independent | Classification Image | numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras | The InceptionV3 model, which is one of the architectural models of CNN, has good results in classifying image cases, so the InceptionV3 model will be developed for carrot freshness classification. This model aims to identify whether a carrot can be considered fresh or rotten based on its visual image. . The results showed that the model with 20 epochs, RMSprop optimizers, learning rate of 0.00001, dense with 128 neurons, Relu activation function, and dropout of 0.2, has successfully achieved an accuracy value of 94.17%, precision of 94.74%, sensitivity of 93.10%, and f1-score of 93.91%. It can be concluded that the classification of carrot freshness using the InceptionV3 model shows excellent performance.
